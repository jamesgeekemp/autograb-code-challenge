Here are the requirements:
• As a Customer I can join the bank by provide a name and an initial deposit.
• The bank should maintain a balance for multiple customers and allow them to deposit,
withdraw and check their current balances.
• As a bank manager you should also be able to see the total balance of the bank
• Ensure that a customer cannot withdraw more money than they have in their account; and
• Allow Customers to transfer money to another customer

You can implement this functionality however you prefer, but here are some guidelines to
make it easier:
• Tests, code readability and maintainability
• Keep it simple, try not to over-engineer the solution. We are going to use this as a
discussion prompt for the interview, we do not expect this to be a difficult challenge to solve.
• There's no need to bother with user input, GUI or persistence – no CLI, React Frontend,
Client/Server, DBs etc;
• All "interaction" must be done by running the tests;
• A README file explaining your design choices along with detailed instructions on how to
run the tests would be very helpful.
