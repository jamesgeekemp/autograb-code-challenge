# autograb-code-challenge

A quick code response to [PoC requirements](./PoCRequirements) provided by the customer.

## How to run tests

1. Get perequisites [node 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
2. Clone the repo to your machine
3. Install dependencies `pnpm install`
4. Run tests `pnpm test`

## Design approach

* Strong-typed domain model implemented in Zod for runtime type checking
* Each use case implemented as a feature and tested at the business unit level
* For purpose of this PoC, all db interations abstracted in a 'store'
* As features grow, and with addition of real backend persistence, would expect to follow Clean Architecture approach

## Omissions / next steps
* Web server and routing
* Security layer
* Data persistence
* Role-based permissions
* Error handling needs improving
* Association between user and account records (not explicitly addressed in this PoC)
* Web and mobile clients
